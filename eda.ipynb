    "The main purpose of the data set's recording is to be able to model the stator and rotor temperatures of a PMSM in real-time. Due to the intricate structure of an electric traction drive, direct measurement with thermal sensors is not possible for rotor temperatures, and even in case of the stator temperatures, sensor outage or even just deterioration can't be administered properly without redundant modeling. In addition, precise thermal modeling gets more and more important with the rising relevance of functional safety.\n",

    "Your task is to design a model with appropriate feature engineering, that estimates four target temperatures in a causal manner (no future values should be considered for actual predictions). In order to maintain real-time capability, model sizes should be as small as possible. Note that temperature estimation in production will be deployed on best-cost hardware of traction drives in an automotive environment, where lean computation and lightweight implementation is key.\n",
